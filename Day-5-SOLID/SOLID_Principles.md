# SOLID Principles in System Design

## Problems Solved by SOLID Principles
1. A class or file does too many things at once, making it hard to fix or update without breaking something else.  
2. Every time you add a new feature, you must edit old code, which can cause bugs.  
3. A child class doesnâ€™t behave like its parent, so when you replace one with the other, the program acts weird or breaks.  
4. A class is forced to use methods it doesnâ€™t need, which makes code bigger and harder to manage.  
5. Big parts of the code depend directly on tiny details, making the system hard to change or test.

## 1. S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

### Definition
A class should have only **one job** or **one reason to change**.  
If a class takes on multiple responsibilities, it becomes harder to maintain and more error-prone.

### ðŸ”´ SRP Violated
**ShoppingCart class** is doing 3 different jobs:
- Managing products & calculating totals (**Cart logic**).
- Printing invoice (**Output/Presentation logic**).
- Saving to database (**Persistence logic**).

ðŸ‘‰ Problem: If we change how invoices are printed or how data is stored, we still have to modify the `ShoppingCart` class â†’ higher risk of bugs.

### ðŸŸ¢ SRP Followed
Responsibilities are split into separate classes:
- `ShoppingCart` â†’ only manages cart items & total calculation.  
- `ShoppingCartPrinter` â†’ only handles printing invoices.  
- `ShoppingCartStorage` â†’ only saves cart data to DB.  

ðŸ‘‰ Benefit:
- Each class is focused & easier to maintain.  
- Future changes (e.g., new invoice format, different database) affect only the related class.

## 2. O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

### Definition
Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be:  
- **Open for extension** â†’ You can add new behavior.  
- **Closed for modification** â†’ You donâ€™t need to edit existing, stable code.  

### ðŸ”´ OCP Violated
`ShoppingCartStorage` has separate methods for saving to SQL, Mongo, and File.  
If we want to add another storage type (e.g., Cloud), we must **edit this class** and add a new method.  

ðŸ‘‰ Problem: Every new feature forces changes in old code â†’ increases risk of bugs.  

### ðŸŸ¢ OCP Followed
- Created a `Persistence` interface.  
- Different classes (`SQLPersistence`, `MongoPersistence`, `FilePersistence`) **implement** this interface.  
- When a new storage type is needed (e.g., `CloudPersistence`), we just **add a new class** without touching existing code.  

ðŸ‘‰ Benefit: System grows by **extension, not modification**.

## 3. L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

### Definition
Objects of a superclass should be **replaceable** with objects of its subclasses **without breaking the program**.  
Subtypes must behave in a way that does **not surprise or break client code**.  

### ðŸ”´ LSP Violated
- `Account` interface forces all subclasses to implement both `deposit()` and `withdraw()`.  
- But `FixedTermAccount` doesnâ€™t logically support withdrawal.  
- To satisfy the interface, it throws an **UnsupportedOperationException**.  

ðŸ‘‰ Problem: When a `FixedTermAccount` is used in place of an `Account`, the client code breaks â†’ violation of LSP.  

### ðŸŸ¢ LSP Followed
Interfaces are split logically:  
- `DepositOnlyAccount` â†’ only for deposit-only accounts.  
- `WithdrawableAccount` â†’ extends deposit and adds withdraw.  

`SavingAccount` and `CurrentAccount` implement `WithdrawableAccount`.  
`FixedTermAccount` implements only `DepositOnlyAccount`.  

ðŸ‘‰ Benefit: Now all subclasses **perfectly match their behavior** â†’ no surprises, no broken client code.
