##  What is System Design?
System Design is the process of defining a system's **architecture**, **components**, **modules**, **interfaces**, and **data**.  
The primary goal is to specify a **well-organized** and **efficient structure** that meets the intended purpose while considering crucial factors like:
- **Scalability**
- **Maintainability**
- **Performance**

## 1. High-Level Design (HLD): The Architectural Blueprint
**High-Level Design (HLD)** focuses on the system's **overall architecture**, not the specific code implementation.  
It's the **"big picture"** view.

### **Key Concerns**
- **Tech Stack:** Choosing languages and frameworks (e.g., Java with Spring Boot).
- **Database Choice:** Deciding between SQL, NoSQL, or a hybrid approach.
- **Server Scaling & Deployment:** Planning for autoscaling, load balancers, and cost optimization on platforms like AWS/GCP.
- **Cost Considerations:** Minimizing cloud and server expenses relative to the system's load.

## 2.ðŸ’€ Low-Level Design (LLD): The Internal Skeleton
**Low-Level Design (LLD)** details the **internal structure** of an application.  
It involves designing the application's "skeleton" by:
- Identifying **classes/objects**
- Mapping their **relationships**
- Defining **data flows**
- Determining how **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** plug into this structure.

### **Core LLD Principles**
1. **Scalability**  
   The code structure should allow for rapid, low-effort expansion to handle large user volumes and new features.

2. **Maintainability**  
   Code should be easy to debug. New features shouldn't break existing ones.

3. **Reusability**  
   Components should be built as loosely coupled, "plug-and-play" modules (e.g., a generic notification service usable across different apps).

##  LLD vs. DSA: Two Approaches to Problem-Solving

**Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** solve **isolated, specific problems**,  
while **LLD** provides the **framework** where those solutions live.

Case:  Let's take the example of building a **ride-sharing app**.

---

###  The DSA-First Approach (Algorithm-Focused)
This approach jumps straight to the **core logic**.

**Problem Decomposition:**
1. Map city intersections to **graph nodes** and roads to **edges**.
2. Use **Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm** to compute the shortest route.
3. Use a **min-heap (priority queue)** to match riders to the closest drivers.

**The Gaps:**
- No definition of entities like **User** or **Rider**.
- Ignores **data security** considerations.
- Missing integration with **payment systems** and **notifications**.
- No scaling strategy for millions of users.

---

###  The LLD-First Approach (Structure-Focused)
This approach **builds the foundation first**.

**Steps:**
1. **Entity Identification**  
   Define the core objects: `User`, `Rider`, `Location`, `NotificationService`, `PaymentGateway`, etc.

2. **Define Relationships & Interactions**  
   - How `User` and `Rider` connect via `Location`.
   - How services like `NotificationService` and `PaymentGateway` integrate.

3. **Address Non-Functional Concerns**  
   - Plan for **data security** (protecting personal info).
   - Architect code to handle **millions of users** without performance collapse.

4. **Apply DSA**  
   Embed the DSA solutions (e.g., shortest-path algorithm, driver-matching heap) inside this well-defined, object-oriented framework.

---

##  Summary & Takeaways
- **DSA** = **Brain** of an application: Algorithms that solve specific tasks.
- **LLD** = **Skeleton**: Object models, class diagrams, and code organization that define where algorithms plug in.
- **HLD** = **Architecture**: The system-wide infrastructure, including the tech stack, databases, and servers.
